I'd never attribute myself the title of "shadowy super coder", because I can't seem to live without sharing a little too much of what I believe to be shadowy, and have made a few too many bugs in my days to consider myself other than "supremely adequate and occasionaly indispensable". 

## Open to Hire

I am currently cast away in the sea of unemployment.  That doesn't mean I'm helpless. No, I've been building.  Here's a little bit of where to start:

## [Blake: a Full-Stack Typescript Project](https://github.com/0xreentrant/blake-bookmark-manager)

A bookmark lists app with Chrome bookmark data imports: [https://github.com/0xreentrant/blake-bookmark-manager](https://github.com/0xreentrant/blake-bookmark-manager)

The opinionated startup stack for 2024 is:
- Next.js 14 SSR framework
- Drizzle ORM
- Lucia Auth
- PostgreSQL DB
- Vercel cloud hosting

## [Blockchain Security Research](https://0xreentrant.github.io)

Web3 is the wild west of money like Limewire was the wild west of data piracy. Get equipped or get rekt.  Here's a blog I keep about secure programming for the blockchain: [https://0xreentrant.github.io](https://0xreentrant.github.io)

Breakdowns include:

- A historic hack and how it happened when everything "looked good"
- What it's like to audit a Rust-based, zero-proof-cryptography backed blockchain
- How simple testing mistakes can obfuscate a multi-million-dollar bug
