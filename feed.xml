<h2>Update, September 1st, 2024:</h2>
<p><strong>Blake is in open Beta at üëâÔ∏è <a href="https://getblake.link">https://getblake.link</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>If you'd like to share thoughts and suggestions, make sure to leave me a comment here or on any of my posts and I'll chat about it with you :)</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>After building as a Full Stack engineer for over a decade, I've collected examples of design preferences and opinions on user experience that inform how software I build look and feel. Yes, they are definitely subjective, without hard science, but I can count on having strong references to other applications with huge user-bases and research teams of their own.</p>
<h2>User Experience: Motivations</h2>
<p>Even though the main goal with Blake is to demonstrate my Full Stack Javascript skills, it is useful to think about how a SaaS can develop through its intended offerings. To spark the imagination, I thought of two other platforms that inspired Blake.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQE45piVypzf1Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1719285951162?e=1732147200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ZQJ8aupprxG1jjSKSF6Qzejp458tI2T4ZnbNbQ8cuQw" alt="Blake: Inspired by the masters of lists..."></p>
<p>The major inspirations to Blake are Notion and Spotify, two apps that revolve around documents and lists. Because a bookmark is relative to a document, Blake is akin to the layer of Notion that collects documents in a simple and easy-to-navigate experience. In the same way, Blake is intended to make collecting bookmarks simple. The interface stays out of the way and only makes itself known when one decides to act on the bookmark.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQHYrUCtlNb3-g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1719285720784?e=1732147200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=5BiFnyXcFKQTMS2CaxnPVwXFUAMg8G_kQduIwVtFaHI" alt="Spotify: the classic &quot;list as an experience&quot;"></p>
<p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGzxKRtbgCpoA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1719285996661?e=1732147200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=oppV7Q6TKRK14wrYeurdu890gP2dlxRyr7YjMnWiFBA" alt="Notion: List of lists and other widgets"></p>
<p>Similarly to Spotify, Blake also intends to portray the list as the primary perspective: a thematic group, as tightly defined or loosely chaotic as the author intends to create. By providing the list as the single top-level organizing container, a user can find multiple ways to make use of it. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lists can become a checklist for the last few days' worth of new bookmarks. One by one they can be explored, kept or removed for their worth, and notes made to collect whatever value each link provides.</li>
<li>Lists can be a way to share knowledge with others. Bookmarks can be curated and shared with others, and others could make comments to collect impressions, opinions, interpretations, etc. for the purpose of growing organizational knowledge between colleagues, friends, and teammates.</li>
<li>Lists can be used to group key information sources, such as rule-sets for favorite table-top games, various documentation for projects in-progress, recipes for the week, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lists are abstract enough to categorize nearly anything, and concrete enough to provide a skeleton for progression and further action.</p>
<h2>Mobile considerations: core trade-offs</h2>
<p>The major trade-off between a desktop app and a mobile one is screen real-estate and portability. With the desktop, we can present more features at once than you can with mobile. It also changes how someone understands how to navigate between content and functionality.</p>
<h3>Fitts's Law</h3>
<p><a href="https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/">Fitts's Law</a> extrapolates to three major rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Touch targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them.</li>
<li>Touch targets should have ample spacing between them.</li>
<li>Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired.</li>
</ol>
<p>That affects a huge majority of UI/UX decisions and trade-offs when designing for mobile. For Blake, that applies in large part to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropdowns vs Drawers: operating commands and actions.</li>
<li>Button Placement: &quot;clickability&quot; with mouse vs the finger.</li>
<li>Priority of Layout: most important controls closest to primary fingers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update - September, 2024:</h2>
<p><strong>Blake is in open Beta at üëâÔ∏è <a href="https://getblake.link">https://getblake.link</a></strong></p>

<p>If you‚Äôve ever found software online, then you‚Äôll be familiar with the ‚Äúlanding page‚Äù. It‚Äôs like the website version of a commercial, or a magazine ad that you can interact with. In the same way, a landing page is made to get us excited about what we might be buying.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs the point behind my design goal with Blake - the social bookmarks manager. By getting to the point at the beginning, and giving an opportunity to explore more themselves, the landing page is where a person can feel as if they‚Äôve come to the right place for whatever they might have been missing.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs sales on one hand, and marketing on another hand. And it is channel-specific: it‚Äôs made for people using web browsers, and less for those spending their time in social apps.</p>
<p>So I made sure that the landing page worked on browsers for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Have some fun resizing the page and you‚Äôll get to see the thoughtful changes according to screen size.</p>
<h2>Ideation and Inspiration</h2>
<p>At each stage of the development process I tend to figure out where are good ‚Äújumping-off points.‚Äù These are like stops on a map to me. Because I could define Blake‚Äôs branding, I could develop a clearer picture of the essentials the landing page would need to adequately explain what Blake provides. Because I‚Äôm not primarily a designer, I need to hone my aesthetic sense using examples from more talented designers. I‚Äôll use some help here.</p>
<h3>Sketching Initial Ideas</h3>
<p>At first I began by visiting <a href="https://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a>. It‚Äôs a large repository of designs from some of the industry‚Äôs best designers, and a great place to jumpstart the design journey. I use their search to target designs for different kinds of UIs. Using it is simple. For example, I wanted to see designs for ‚Äú<a href="https://dribbble.com/search/saas-landing-page">SaaS landing page</a>‚Äù, or ‚Äú<a href="https://dribbble.com/search/newsletter-signup">newsletter signup</a>‚Äù.</p>

<h2>Leveraging AI for Inspiration</h2>
<p>I knew that I wanted to play with design elements that were easily recognizable and reassuring. The brand idea for naming the idea Blake revolved around a helpful persona that made organizing and sparking community possible. This app would be a trusted facilitator for getting discussion started. Along those lines, I decided on the Alegria style of illustration, or Corporate Memphis. Sometimes it‚Äôs hated, but it‚Äôs often a light-hearted source of delight for marketing materials, and it‚Äôs not yet squeezed of its aesthetic usefulness: Blake is a lightweight tool, and its aesthetics should reflect that.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I began to ideate with the generative image creation functionality on ChatGPT. There were quite a few iterations before I settled on the final idea for the landing page's main illustration.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHnOmtXrqmszQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1725335803953?e=1732147200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ZXlmlnmQ76TNBS1RmGTV1bbbKteph31wFObN4Em9pv0" alt="ChatGPT and using the highlighter to help make edits while prompting"></p>
<p>Eventually I settled with this for the landing page's main illustration:</p>
