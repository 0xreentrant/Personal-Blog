# Who is Alex?
<img src="images/me.png" style="float: right;width: 35%; padding-left: 2em;">

  - 12+ years as a Full Stack Software Engineer, specializing in Javascript and Typescript.
  - Team Lead and Senior for multiple teams.
  - Proven experience in building apps for the web, from concept to deployment.

I am currently a white belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and recently swam for the first time in almost 10 years.  

I wouldn't attribute to myself the title of "shadowy super coder", because I love collaborating with other passionate coders and consider myself closer to "supremely adequate and occasionaly indispensable". 


## Open to Hire

I'm currently looking for employment.  That doesn't mean I've been sitting on my hands... No, I've been building and keeping busy.  Here's a little bit of where to look for the latest in what I've been up to:

## [Blake: a Full-Stack Typescript Project](https://github.com/0xreentrant/blake-bookmark-manager)

A bookmark lists app with Chrome bookmark data imports: [https://github.com/0xreentrant/blake-bookmark-manager](https://github.com/0xreentrant/blake-bookmark-manager)

The opinionated startup stack for 2024 is:
- Next.js 14 SSR framework
- Drizzle ORM
- Lucia Auth
- PostgreSQL DB
- Vercel cloud hosting

## [Blockchain Security Research](https://0xreentrant.github.io)

Web3 is the wild west of money like Limewire was the wild west of data piracy. Get equipped or get rekt.  Here's a blog I keep about secure programming for the blockchain: [https://0xreentrant.github.io](https://0xreentrant.github.io)

Breakdowns include:

- A historic hack and how it happened when everything "looked good"
- What it's like to audit a Rust-based, zero-proof-cryptography backed blockchain
- How simple testing mistakes can obfuscate a multi-million-dollar bug
